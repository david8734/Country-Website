One could witness the strong devotion to nature, family, and community in every aspect of living, from daily customs to major celebrations. Japan, despite taking advantages of modern technologies such as robotics, electronics, and modern transportation, still practices the traditional ones that, in the long run, define their identity.</p>

Shrines and temples can be found in almost every city, offering spaces for reflection amid the bustle of modern life. Many people visit these sacred places during New Year’s celebrations, festivals, or personal milestones, reinforcing the idea that spirituality is woven into daily routines rather than something separate from them.</p>
