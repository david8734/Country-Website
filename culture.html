<p>Japan’s culture blends ancient traditions with modern ideas. People value respect, politeness, and community, which shape daily life. The culture includes art, anime, manga, music, technology, and practices that go back thousands of years.</p>

<p>Traditional arts like origami, calligraphy, and ink painting have been passed down for generations, while modern creations such as video games and animation have made Japan famous worldwide. Respect is central to Japanese life — people bow when greeting, remove their shoes before entering homes, and use polite language in conversation. Together, these customs show Japan’s balance of tradition and innovation.</p>
